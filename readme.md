# [Colors (new)](https://colors2.jipfr.nl)


This project lets you easily store and share your color palettes. 

## Setup

You'll need to install the relevant packages (`npm install`) and set up the `.env` file, which you can base off of the `sample.env` file.

You'll also need a MongoDB server running with a `colors` database.
